# Extend-abstract-class

Abstract class: is a restricted class that cannot be used to create objects (to access it, it must be inherited from another class).
Abstract method: can only be used in an abstract class, and it does not have a body. The body is provided by the subclass (inherited from).
Abstract class is Incompleteness. It should be completed by its child class.
In these project Parent class is the Vehicle class and the scooter and car are the child class. The parent class is an Abstract class and the isStartWithKick method is incomplete. So compulsory child classes have to complete it or make their class abstract. But here Both the child class completed the method for Scooter yes true It starts with a kick and for a car, it's No false it does not start with a kick. vehicles class is used to see the result of which vehicle is started by a kick.
